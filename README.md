This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript functions where failure to explicitly handle empty or null parameters leads to unexpected runtime errors. The `bug.vbs` file shows the original erroneous code. The `bugSolution.vbs` file presents the corrected code which includes an explicit `Exit Function` statement within the conditional block that checks for empty parameters.  This ensures the function gracefully exits without errors when an empty parameter is passed.
